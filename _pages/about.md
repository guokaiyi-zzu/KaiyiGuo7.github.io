I'm a second-year Master's student from [School of Software](https://www.se.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interests focus on **human-computer interaction**, **smart health**, **wireless sensing**, and **applied machine learning**. By exploring diverse sensing modalities, hardware forms, and innovative machine learning methods, I aspire to transform complex interactive techniques, once restricted to laboratory settings, into simpler, more universally applicable solutions in real-world scenarios.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Dong Wang](http://www.se.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/286) of RFID and IoT Lab from [School of Software](https://www.se.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

You can find my CV here: [Kaiyi Guo's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV (2).pdf).

**Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. starting in Fall 2026.**
